Observations

With this example, the Dart analyzer produces an error informing you that the variables must be initialized because they're non-nullable. You'll fix that in the next section.
Dart's main method is named main(). If you need access to command-line arguments, you can add them: main(List<String> args).
The main() method lives at the top level. In Dart, you can define code outside of classes. Variables, functions, getters, and setters can all live outside of classes.
The original Java example declares private instance variables using the private tag, which Dart doesn't use. You'll learn more about privacy a little later, in "Add a read-only variable."
Neither main() nor Bicycle is declared as public, because all identifiers are public by default. Dart doesn't have keywords for public, private, or protected.
Dart uses two-character inden
tation by convention instead of four. You don't need to worry about Dart's whitespace conventions, thanks to a handy tool called dart format. As the Dart code conventions ( Effective Dart) say, "The official whitespace-handling rules for Dart are whatever dart format produces."
